# Consistent retrieval of crop yields using a data assimilation platform
**Work in progress**

This repository contains the code for a project run by the Institute of Environmental Sciences (CML) at Leiden University, subcontracted from the Netherlands Space Office (NSO) within the [FPCUP framework](https://www.copernicus-user-uptake.eu/).
The aim of the project was to develop a data product improving the retrieval and prediction of crop yields by assimilating existing models (WOFOST) and satellite data (Copernicus).
Please note that it is currently under very active development and not yet ready to be used by others.

More documentation will follow.
