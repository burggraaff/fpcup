# Consistent retrieval of crop yields using a data assimilation platform
**Work in progress**

This repository is used for my postdoctoral project on the retrieval and prediction of crop yields by assimilating existing models (WOFOST) and satellite data (Copernicus).
Please note that it is currently under very active development and not yet ready to be used by others.

More documentation will follow.
